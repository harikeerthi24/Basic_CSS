        Our font catalog places typography front and center, inviting users to explore, sort, and
        test fonts for use in more than 135 languages. We showcase individual type designers and
        foundries, giving you valuable information about the typographers and their process, as 
        well as analytics on usage and demographics. Our series of thematic collections helps you
        discover new fonts that have been vetted and organized by our team of designers, engineers, 
        and collaborators, and our default sort organizes fonts based on popularity, trends, and your 
        geographic location. You can also create your own highly customized collections by filtering 
        families, weights, and scripts, plus test color themes, and review sample copy. Collections 
        can be shared, making it easy to collaborate on projects and ensure typography is optimized 
        and streamlined throughout the design and engineering process. In 2021, we added icons to our
        Google Fonts catalog, expanding expressive capability for our users. Our first set was the
        Material icons—delightful, beautifully crafted symbols for common communication needs.
